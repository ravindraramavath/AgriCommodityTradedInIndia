# eNamData
This repository contains the data of India Agriculture Commodity trading data in APMC markets. The data was pulled to check what happened during #JuntaLockdown announced to fight COVID-19 in India.

## Source data
The data has been pulled from [eNam dasbhoard](https://enam.gov.in/web/dashboard/trade-data) which is available only for one week at a time.

The data is available from 2019 January onwards till last week ending on a saturday. 

## Data update
Data available from 01-Jan-19 to 30-Dec-20.

## Note
1) 38 new mandis have been integrated into enam on 15th May 20, so before analysing look at mandi level data.   
2) Sometime in September, the Indian Government enacted 3 new laws [Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2020/222039.pdf), [Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/15511/1/A2020_20.pdf), [Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2020/222038.pdf). It may have led to APMCs losing trade share and crop arrivals may have fallen due to farmers and traders directly negotiating and trading outside of mandis.
